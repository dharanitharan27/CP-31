Note
  Notice that each goal increases the efficiency of the team that scores by 1. But it also simultaneously decreases
the efficiency of the opposite team by 1. This means, if we maintain the sum of efficiency for all teams, each goal 
does not change the sum. Therefore, the sum must be 0 .

In order to make the sum to be 0, the efficiency of the missing team must be equal to the sum of efficiency of the
other nâˆ’1 teams, multiplied by âˆ’1.
