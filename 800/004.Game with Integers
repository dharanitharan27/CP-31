Note
        Consider the remainder from dividing n by 3 before the first move. If it is equal to 1
 or 2, then Vanya can make the number n divisible by 3 after the first move, i.e. he wins. Let
the remainder be 0, then Vanya must change the number after which it will not be divisible by 3.
Then Vova can do the same operation as Vanya and make it divisible by 3 again.
