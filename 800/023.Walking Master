#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int a,b,c,d;
        cin>>a>>b>>c>>d;
        if(b<=d&&c<=a+d-b) {
			cout<<(d-b)+(a+d-b-c)<<"\n";

			cout<<"-1\n";
		}
    }
}
Note
      The value of b is always non-decreasing, and the value of a b is always non-increasing.It is possible to move 
from (a, b) to (c, d) if and only if d > b and abcd, since the value of b is always non-decreasing and the
value of a b is always non-increasing.If it is possible, the answer is (d - b) + ((a+db) - c). 
One possible way is (a, b)→(a+db,d) → (c, d).
        Another way to understand this: (a, b) (a+db, d) → (c, d) is always a valid path if it is possible 
to move from (a, b) to (c, d). So first let aa + (db) and bd, then the answer only depends on a and c.
